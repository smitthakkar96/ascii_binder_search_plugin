# AsciiBinder Search Plugin  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smitthakkar96/ascii_binder_search_plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smitthakkar96/ascii_binder_search_plugin)

## What is this?
This is a small plugin that generates a data.json which contains the content and title of each page and puts it in each distro. This file is indexed and searched with search template client side. This plugin provides a default search template that is ready to use, but if you want you can use your own search template. See the instructions below.

## Installation instructions

1. Create a virtualenv

        python3 -m venv <name of virtualenv>

        pip install git+https://github.com/smitthakkar96/ascii_binder_search_plugin
